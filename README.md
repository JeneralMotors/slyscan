## About
This Python script provides a multi-threaded port scanning tool designed to scan multiple hosts for open ports within a specified range. It utilizes concurrent programming with multiprocessing and threading to efficiently scan ports for multiple hosts.

## Dependencies

- `socket`
- `argparse`
- `multiprocessing`
- `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
- `tqdm`
- `rich`

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Scanning:**
  + Utilizes threading to concurrently scan open ports, optimizing speed for each host.

- **Multi-processed Architecture:**
  + Harnesses the power of multiprocessing to perform simultaneous port scans across multiple hosts, enhancing overall scanning efficiency.

- **Port Range Support:**
  + Supports a flexible port specification, allowing scanning of single ports, multiple ports, and port ranges.

- **Dynamic Progress Tracking:**
  + Employs a dynamic progress bar using `tqdm` for real-time visualization of scanning progress.

- **Colorful Console Output:**
  + Utilizes the `rich` library to provide visually appealing and informative console output.

- **User-friendly Command-line Interface:**
  + Accepts command-line arguments for specifying hosts and ports, making it easy to customize scanning parameters.

- **Robust Port Parsing:**
  + Parses a variety of port specifications, including single ports and port ranges, ensuring flexibility in configuration.

## Example Usage

```bash
$ python port_scanner.py --hosts 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 --ports 80 443 8080-8090
```

## Output

## Performance

* Passing **2 hosts** and a **portrange of 1-65535** as arguments to the script, in a **4 thread CPU** takes on **average 100 seconds to completely scan the hosts ports**.
* **RESULTS** are **ALWAYS ACCURATE** *unless* the packets are being **BLOCKED** by *Network security measures*, such as **firewalls**.
